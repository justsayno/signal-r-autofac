# Project to show how to get Angular2 and MVC5/WebApi2 working with Autofac

This was taken from the repo here:

https://github.com/sstorie/experiments/tree/master/angular2-signalr

All I have done is add Autofac integrations.

## Running the project

**Backend:**
Open the project in Visual Studio. Run the project.

**Front end**

Install http-server
```
npm install -g http-server
```

Run a server in the client fonder
```
cd client
http-server # open browser and navgiate to http://localhost:8080
```
